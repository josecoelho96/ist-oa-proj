# Selecting reliable sensors via convex optimization

## Optimization and Alghoritms course project.

### Abstract
*Extraction of trusted and relevant information from sensor networks by fusing data from a multitude of heterogeneous, distinct, but possibly unreliable or irrelevant sensors. Recovering the desirable view of the environment from the maximum number of dependable sensors while specifying the unreliable ones. Performance of some methods is tested analytically, and through simulations.*
